"""Makes the narrated video for From neurons to next steps from the deck: each slide is shown while
its narration plays. The narration is the slide's speaker notes, read by a computer voice (Kokoro).

Run after build_deck.py:  python3 website/presentation/build_video.py <folder with kokoro-v1.0.onnx and voices-v1.0.bin>
Writes website/video/from-neurons-to-next-steps.mp4 and .vtt. A recording at website/video/voice/NN.wav (or .m4a, .mp3)
replaces the computer voice for slide NN; see application/recording-script.md."""
